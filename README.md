# <a name="developer-start"></a>For developer
To run this project you need to have installed:

* Java 11+
* Tomcat
* MySQL (Optional)

<hr>

This project is **MVC-based** and thus has:

* DAO layer (with two implementations: inner storage based on List and outer storage based on MySQL RDBMS); 
* Service layer;
* authentication and authorization filters; 
* Servlets;
* JSP pages.

<hr>

_Launch guide:_

1. Open the project in your IDE.
2. Add it as maven project.
3. Configure Tomcat:
    * add an artifact;
    * add SDK 11.0.3.
4. Add SDK 11.0.3 in project structure.
5. Change a path in **/internet-shop_project/src/main/resources/log4j2.xml** on line 7. It has to reach your logFile.
6. Run the project.
7. If you launch this project for the first time: 
    * Run InjectDefaultUsersController by URL = .../initialization to create default users. By default, there are one user with the USER role (login = "user1", password = "user1") 
and one with an ADMIN role (login = "admin", password = "admin")*.

*Run injection **every time** you run your project if you use the inner storage, and only **on first run** if you use MySQL.
<hr>

To work with MySQL you need to*:

1. At /internet-shop_project/src/main/java/com/internetshop/util/ConnectionUtil class use username, password and URL for your DB to create a Connection.
2. Use file /internet-shop_project/src/main/resources/init_db.sql to create a schema and all the tables required by this app in MySQL database.

*_This project uses MySQL by default_

<hr>

To work with inner storage you need to:

1. Remove @Dao annotations from DAOs in src/main/java/com/internetshop/dao/jdbc;
2. Add @Dao annotations to DAOs in src/main/java/com/internetshop/dao/impl.
